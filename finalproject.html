  <h1>What is this page?</h1>
   
   <p> This page is a part of my final project in my computer science class. Its purpose is to 
   show what we have learned and how we use it. So far, we have learned how to create websites,
   create the styling, and learned all the tags needed. I have learned how to make the screen of 
   the website fit any screen it is on, how to create side boxes, and how to ake images appear 
   on the screen.</p>
   
   <h1>Why does it exist?</h1>
   
   <p> The reason for this page existing is so that my teacher knows that I understand everything
   that has been taught this year. So he knows that I know how to make a website and I know how to 
   make it colorful and pretty. My teacher wants to see that I still remember all the tags and 
   that I remember in what format it is used.</p>
