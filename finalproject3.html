  <h1>Should People Be Able To Illegally Download Music?</h1>
   
   <p>People illegally downloading music has been a problem for many years now.
   Even though it is not that big of a deal anymore, artists, companies, and producers 
   still need to make the same money and they cannot make it if it is being downloaded
   illegally. </p>
   
   <h1>Why should it be legal?</h1>
   
   <p> In my opinion, music should be available and free for everyone to enjoy.
   Music is made so that people can enjoy it and feel what they need to, and it should
   not be at a cost. Downloading music for free should not be illegal. It should be legal
   because artists make enough money from their concerts and merchandise that they dont really
   need more.</p>
   
   <h1>Why should it be illegal?</h1>
   
   <p> Downloading music should be illegal because it is stealing from the artists who put
   hard work into their music. The artists spend a lot of time working on songs so that 
   people are able to listen to it, but in order for them to continue making music,
   they need to be paid. With illegally downloading music, the artists aren't 
   getting paid and therefore, they wont make any more music.</p>
   
   <h1>Will I do it?</h1>
   
   <p> Downloading music illegally is a very easy way to get your music without having to pay,
   and for me that is a good thing because I do not have the money to buy the songs.
   I will download music illegally because even though I know it is not the best thing to do,
   it helps me be able to listen to my favorite artists and their new music.</p>
