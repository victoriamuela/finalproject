  <h1>Interests</h1>
  
  <p> I have many interests, but the thing I like to do most would probably be to listen
  to music. Listening to music can always help me, or even put me in a better mood. 
  Music itself is just so full of emotions, but only certain people are able to hear them.
  I like to watch Netflix when I have nothing else to do, and one of my favorite things to 
  watch is Supernatural. There are many shows that I watch multiple times over and over 
  again, but its because they are such good shows, I cant help but watch them several times.
